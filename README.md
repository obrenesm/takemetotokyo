# About

This project was created as a personal showcase of React skiils and to be used on job applications, you can see it running at https://take-me.tokyo




## Tech

This project consist on a React App bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (Now I know it's not the best way to start).

It makes use of a couple of libraries:

- React Three Fiber for the 3D stuff
- Gsap for animations


#

React is not the appropiate tech for this scenario but since I wanted to use some react and build a page to apply why not combine both? However if you find it useful feel free to use it as a reference if you want to build something similar.
